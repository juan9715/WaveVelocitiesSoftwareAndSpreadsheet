# WaveVelocitiesSoftwareAndSpreadsheet

Welcome!

This repository contains the files comprising the MatLab script And Excel Spreadsheets used for the following articles

Article 1: Wave Velocities and Poisson Ratio in Loose Sandy Martian Regolith Under Low Stresses. Part 1: Laboratory Investigation
Article 2: Wave Velocities and Poisson Ratio in Loose Sandy Martian Regolith Under Low Stresses. Part 2: Theoretical Analysis

Matlab scrips make use of the GUI capabilities of MATLAB

Data can be used with these scripts

The Excel spreadsheets contain the work and computations detailed on the article.

The DATA folder contains the files comprising the data used for the following articles:

Each sample folder separates between P and S waves

File "DATOSX.txt" indicates the stress level associated to each file (i.e. line 5 indicates the stress level for the measurement in file "scope_0.5.csv")

Each file contains the oscilloscope record for the two channels used in the oscilloscope, and may be visualized in the software of preference of the user
