# WaveVelocitiesSoftwareAndSpreadsheet

Welcome!

This repository contains the files comprising the MatLab script And Excel Spreadsheets used for the following articles

Article 1: Wave Velocities and Poisson Ratio in Loose Sandy Martian Regolith Under Low Stresses. Part 1: Laboratory Investigation
Article 2: Wave Velocities and Poisson Ratio in Loose Sandy Martian Regolith Under Low Stresses. Part 2: Theoretical Analysis

The files are organized in three folders

The Matlab scripts folder contins the scripts necessary for the software tool developed for wave velocity analysis
Matlab scrips make use of the GUI capabilities of MATLAB
The data contained in the 'Experimental Data' folder can be used with these scripts

The 'Experimental Data' folder contians the measurements performed on the 4 samples, separated into separate subfolders 
Each sample folder separates between P and S waves
File "DATOSX.txt" contained in every subfolder indicates the stress level associated to each file (i.e. line 5 indicates the stress level for the measurement in file "scope_0.5.csv")
Each .csv file contains the oscilloscope record for the two channels used in the oscilloscope, and may be visualized in the software of preference of the user

The 'Excel spreadsheets' folder contains the work and computations detailed on the article in four organized Spreadsheets and may be used to fit the proposed model on new data.
